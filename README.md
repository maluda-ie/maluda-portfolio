# Maluda Portfolio Website

User-Centric Frontend Development - First Milestone Project

This website was the first I developed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Web Development Diploma. 
The aim of the site is to promote Maluda's pattern design work to potential clients. 

THe finished demo site can be found here: 
[Maluda] (https://ide.c9.io/maluda/maluda-portfolio) 


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4.2.1
- JavaScript

## Features Implemented

I relied heavily on Bootstrap during the development of this site. As a student, my aim was to become proficient 
in this technology. I used a snippet of JavaScript to enable and disable the lightbox feature which
I felt would enhance the UX on larger devices. I found this snippet here: [Lightbox for Bootstrap](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/).
I used Bootstrap's scrollspy feature to enhance navigation particularly on larger devices. 
I adapted the code from here: [Bootstrap Scrollspy Feature](https://www.w3schools.com/booTsTrap/bootstrap_scrollspy.asp)


## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a password protected page to offer potential buyers an opportunity to view my 
complete catalogue easily. I would also like to expand the scope of the site to incorporate my web development work 
as part of my portfolio. 


## User Experience

I decided to develop a one page site using Bootstrap's scrollspy feature to enable ease of navigation. Since the imagery on the
site is bold, I settled on clean and minimal styling as not to overload the senses. 

The about page provides some information about the studio to potential clients. The portfolio section is a clean and neatly organised
selection of current and past projects that users can view in orer to. Finally, the contact section allows users to get in touch with 
the studio about potential collaborations. At the bottomof the site, social media links provide opportunitie to connect. 


## Deployment

The site is deployed on GitHub
