# Maluda Portfolio Website

User-Centric Frontend Development - First Milestone Project

This website was the first I developed as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Web Development Diploma. 
The aim of the site is to promote Maluda's pattern design work to potential clients, provide information
about the designer and to allow the user to get in touch.  

The finished demo site can be found here: 
[Maluda](https://ide.c9.io/maluda/maluda-portfolio) 


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4.2.1
- JavaScript

## Features Implemented

I used Bootstrap during the development of this site. As a student, my aim was to become proficient 
in this technology. I used a snippet of JavaScript to enable and disable the lightbox feature which
I felt would enhance the UX on larger devices. I found this snippet here: [Lightbox for Bootstrap](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/).  
The lightbox feature is disabled on smaller devices as it is not needed. I used Bootstrap's scrollspy feature to enhance navigation 
particularly on larger devices. I adapted the code from here: [Bootstrap Scrollspy Feature](https://www.w3schools.com/booTsTrap/bootstrap_scrollspy.asp). 


## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a password protected page to offer potential buyers an opportunity to view the 
complete catalogue easily without making unseen work public. I would also like to expand the scope of the site to 
incorporate my web development work as part of the portfolio. 


## User Experience

Providing a positive user experience was one of the main goals of this project. Bearing in mind that the majority of web users 
use their phones to access the internet, a mobile-first approach was implemented. That said, the site is fully responsive and 
works well on all devices in accordance with the brief. 

The primary aim of the site is to showcase Maluda's pattern design work to potential clients. With this in mind, for this version 
it was considered crucial to include about, portfolio and contact sections. The interaction design included Bootstrap's scrollspy 
feature to enable ease of navigation on this one page site. Conventions were adhered to to ensure the site was intuitive and 
easy to use. Social media links can be found in the footer of the site and the navbar is fixed to the top on large devices and
in the form of a hamburder menu on smaller devices. The wireframes can be viewed here: [wireframes](website-wireframes.pdf)

Clean and minimal styling is used throughout the site to showcase the patterns.

Upon landing on the site, the user meets a bold image that represents the aesthetic of the designer. The about page provides some 
information about the studio to potential clients and visitor to the site. The portfolio section which uses Bootstrap cards, is a 
clean and neatly organised selection of current and past projects. This section gives the user 
Finally, the contact section allows users to get in touch with 
the studio about potential collaborations. At the bottomof the site, social media links provide opportunitie to connect.
